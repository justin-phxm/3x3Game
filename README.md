## Overview

Welcome to the Puzzle Game! This is a fun and challenging game where you can test your problem-solving skills. The game is inspired by classic sliding puzzle games like the 15-puzzle and 8-puzzle.

In this game, you'll be presented with a grid of numbered tiles, with one tile missing. Your goal is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space to solve the puzzle. The objective is to arrange the tiles in numerical order, starting from 1 and ending with an empty space in the bottom right corner. It's a simple concept, but it can be surprisingly tricky!

## Features

- Interactive game board with a grid of tiles.
- Smooth tile sliding animations. **In Development**
- Solvability check to ensure the puzzle is solvable.
- Shuffle option for a new challenge.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrowkeys or onscreen buttons on the empty space to slide into an adjacent tile.
2. Continue sliding tiles until you've arranged them in numerical order.
3. Try to solve the puzzle as quickly as possible and challenge your friends to beat your time!
4. If you get stuck, you can use the shuffle option to start over with a new configuration.
